## What is Scrounge?


##### The situation:

It's Sunday evening and you didn't get a chance to do your weekly grocery trip. You're kitchen is far from fully-stocked but you need to come up with an adequate meal for your family.

##### The solution:

Scrounge gives you a straightforward way to plug in the few ingredients you have and find an inspiring recipe based on those ingredients. Add and remove items until you land on a dish you like, then use the simplified directions to prepare it.
